In this Project the aim was to create a platform for secondary school students to take a Personality test from a custom made Questionaire. With this 
questionaire a Machine Learning model in the backend of the web app predicts their Affinity to be science,art or commercial students. I implemented a
K-Nearest Neighbour clustering algorithm to perform this prediction.
